# BasicHTMLWebpage
This web page uses a form to display text boxes for a user to enter the trucks that are in each spot. 



I have decided to not use this html webpage to accomplish what we are trying to get done but still wanted to publish it for future references. This project has basic form fuctions, and contains some links, as well as has some css styling. I will be developing this same type of idea but to be program based instead of web base, and plan to use C# or Visual Basic. Stay tuned for an update.
